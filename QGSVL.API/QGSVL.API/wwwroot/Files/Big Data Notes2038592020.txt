what is big data and characteristics

- I would say Big data is extremely huge volume of data.
-what is considered as extremely huge volume of data ? 10 GB ? 10 TB 
There is no hard number tha defines big data. 
this is because of two reasons 1. data that is considered to be huge today may not be considered as big a year from now. 2. its all relative , the data that i consider to be big may not be the case for companies like google and facebook.

lets say if we aare defining big data problems in terms of volume
then we can say that the scale of pettabyte is definately something big.

but volume is not the only factor that defines big data.

here is y  ,
consider we have open a startup and made a social media application.At the beginning we have x numbers of users and 1 tb of database now this is not a big problem because we can handle this with our traditinal tools and a good database system is all you need but 

=> the more imp question is the growth rate  suppose that if our application is better than other social media app and its growth rate is double in every 3 months. after sometime it will turn into huge data and we will we requiring a scalable big data solution.
 
 so while defining big data, the speed of the data that grows also matters. or we can say the velocity. 

mostly volume and velocity are the deciding factor to know where we have big data or not.

=> but also 1 more factor that matters : Variety. Our traditional database are highly structured but in our social media application we will have data in different formats that can we text, photos, videos,etc.. . that would be hard to process and analyze.


so whenever you ask yourself we have big data problem or not, we consider these three factors
